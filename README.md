‚ò∏Ô∏è Deploying to GKE, EKS, or AKS with kubeconfig
You can deploy your Kubernetes manifests to any cloud provider using kubectl and your kubeconfig file. Here's how:
‚úÖ Steps for All Providers:
1. Ensure kubectl is installed and configured with your cluster:
1. kubectl config use-context <your-cluster-context>

2. Apply your manifests:
2. kubectl apply -f MyCoachAgent_K8s_Manifests/

üîπ For EKS (AWS):
‚Ä¢ Use eksctl to create and manage clusters.

üîπ For AKS (Azure):
‚Ä¢ Use az aks get-credentials to configure kubeconfig.

2. Click New repository secret
3. Add secrets like:
    ‚Ä¢ KUBE_CONFIG_DATA (base64-encoded kubeconfig)
    ‚Ä¢ OPENAI_API_KEY
    ‚Ä¢ PINECONE_API_KEY
    ‚Ä¢ PINECONE_ENV

üõ†Ô∏è Debugging FastAPI JWT Authentication
If your JWT-based login or protected routes are failing:
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Ensure python-jose[cryptography] is installed:
‚Ä¢ pip install python-jose[cryptography]

‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Use OAuth2PasswordBearer and Depends properly in your routes.
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Validate the token with:
‚Ä¢ payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])

‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Return a 401 error if the token is invalid or expired.
